# Binary VulcDataFormat format specification
Binary VDF is a file format designed to store many data types easily.\
VDF uses **primitive elements**, **complex elements** and **array elements**.

## Primitive elements
There are 9 primitive element types:
| name      | size     | payload                                 | code  |
| --------- | -------- | --------------------------------------- | :---: |
| `boolean` | 1 byte   | 0 -> false, any other -> true           |   0   |
| `byte`    | 1 byte   | 8-bit signed integer                    |   1   |
| `short`   | 2 bytes  | 16-bit signed integer                   |   2   |
| `int`     | 4 bytes  | 32-bit signed integer                   |   3   |
| `long`    | 8 bytes  | 64-bit signed integer                   |   4   |
| `float`   | 4 bytes  | 32-bit IEEE 754 binary32 floating point |   5   |
| `double`  | 8 bytes  | 64-bit IEEE 754 binary64 floating point |   6   |
| `char`    | 2 bytes  | UTF-16 character                        |   7   |
| `string`  | 2+ bytes | string size (2 bytes) + UTF-8 string    |   8   |

## Complex elements
There are 2 complex element types:
| name     | code  |
| -------- | :---: |
| `object` |   9   |
| `list`   |  10   |

They contain other elements and are encoded in different manners.\
Only complex elements can be used as top-level elements.

### Object
An object element contains **unordered named elements**.\
This is a representation of its payload:
```
for each element:
    element's code ('byte' element payload)
    element's name ('string' element payload)
    element's payload

'end mark' code: -1 ('byte' element payload)
```

### List
A list element contains **ordered unnamed elements**.\
This is a representation of its payload:
```
for each element:
    element's code ('byte' element payload)
    element's payload

'end mark' code: -1 ('byte' element payload)
```

## Array elements
There are 11 array element types (one per non-array element type):
| name        | code  |
| ----------- | :---: |
| `boolean[]` |  11   |
| `byte[]`    |  12   |
| `short[]`   |  13   |
| `int[]`     |  14   |
| `long[]`    |  15   |
| `float[]`   |  16   |
| `double[]`  |  17   |
| `char[]`    |  18   |
| `string[]`  |  19   |
| `object[]`  |  20   |
| `list[]`    |  21   |

Arrays are ordered and have a length. They contain only one element type.\
This is a representation of its payload:
```
array's length ('int' element payload)

for each element:
    element's payload
```
