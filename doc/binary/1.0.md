# Binary VulcDataFormat format specification
Binary VDF (BVDF) is a typed, element-based, data format used to store big amount of data efficiently.

Each element has a **type** and a **payload**.\
The type is a 1 byte code, while the payload depends on the type.

There are 22 types, split in 3 categories:
- primitive types
- complex types
- array types

**Primitive elements** store raw data.\
**Complex elements** contain zero or more elements, of any type. They can be used as top-level element.\
**Array elements** contain zero or more non-array elements of the same type.

## Primitive types
There are 9 primitive types and each of them has a different payload:
| description | size     | payload                                 | code  |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------------------- | :---: |
| `boolean`   | 1 byte   | 0 (false), any other (true)             |   0   |
| `byte`      | 1 byte   | 8-bit signed integer                    |   1   |
| `short`     | 2 bytes  | 16-bit signed integer                   |   2   |
| `int`       | 4 bytes  | 32-bit signed integer                   |   3   |
| `long`      | 8 bytes  | 64-bit signed integer                   |   4   |
| `float`     | 4 bytes  | 32-bit IEEE 754 binary32 floating point |   5   |
| `double`    | 8 bytes  | 64-bit IEEE 754 binary64 floating point |   6   |
| `char`      | 2 bytes  | UTF-16 character                        |   7   |
| `string`    | 2+ bytes | string size (2 bytes) + UTF-8 string    |   8   |

## Complex types
Complex Elements contain other elements, of **any** type.\
They can **nest**.\
These elements can be used as top-level element, meaning that a BVDF file must contain exactly one complex element (which can then contain other elements).

There are 2 complex types:
| description | code  |
| ----------- | :---: |
| `object`    |   9   |
| `list`      |  10   |

### Object
An object is a structure which contains **unordered key-value pairs**.\
This is a representation of its payload:
```
for each element:
    element's code ('byte' element payload)
    element's name ('string' element payload)
    element's payload

'end mark' code: -1 ('byte' element payload)
```

At the end, the `element's code` is replaced by the end mark `-1`.

### List
A list is a structure which contains **ordered elements**.\
This is a representation of its payload:
```
for each element:
    element's code ('byte' element payload)
    element's payload

'end mark' code: -1 ('byte' element payload)
```

## Array types
An array is a structure which contains **ordered elements of one type**.\
Each element (except arrays) has an array variant with a **unique code**.

| description | code  |
| ----------- | :---: |
| `boolean[]` |  11   |
| `byte[]`    |  12   |
| `short[]`   |  13   |
| `int[]`     |  14   |
| `long[]`    |  15   |
| `float[]`   |  16   |
| `double[]`  |  17   |
| `char[]`    |  18   |
| `string[]`  |  19   |
| `object[]`  |  20   |
| `list[]`    |  21   |

This is a representation of an array's payload:
```
array's length ('int' element payload)

for each element:
    element's payload
```

Note: the `element's code` is not present in the payload because the array type is unique.
