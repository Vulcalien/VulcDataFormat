    Textual VulcDataFormat Specification
</h1>

Textual VDF (TVDF or simply VDF) is a textual file format for data.
VDF supports 22 different types. Each file contains one top-level element.

## Top-level Element
Since element has a **type** and a **value**, the top-level element must specify both of them.

This is the syntax for it:
```vdf
<type> <value>
```

For example, this represents an integer whose value is 3:
```vdf
int 3
```

Note: whitespaces and newlines *before the type*, *between the type and the value* and *after the value* are ignored.

<hr>

There are two exception for this rule: objects and lists. Top-level elements of this type don't need to specify the type.

So to represent an empty object, this syntax is valid:
```vdf
{}
```
While this represents an empty list:
```vdf
[]
```

## Element types
There are 22 element types, split in 3 categories: **primitive**, **complex** and **array** types.

| Primitive | Complex |       Array |
| :-------- | :-----: | ----------: |
| `boolean` |  `obj`  | `boolean[]` |
| `byte`    | `list`  |    `byte[]` |
| `short`   |         |   `short[]` |
| `int`     |         |     `int[]` |
| `long`    |         |    `long[]` |
| `float`   |         |   `float[]` |
| `double`  |         |  `double[]` |
| `char`    |         |    `char[]` |
| `string`  |         |  `string[]` |
|           |         |     `obj[]` |
|           |         |    `list[]` |

Note: types are **not** case-sensitive.

## TODO - this document is not complete

<!-- - primitive types
  - Elements of this type store raw data, such as a number, a string or a boolean value.
- complex types
  - Elements of this type store other elements, no matter their type. They are expecially useful as top-level elements, as they can store many values.
- array types
  - These types store many elements of one just type. -->

<!-- ## Primitive types
Elements of a primitive type store raw data, such as a number, a string or a boolean value.
There are 9 primitive types and each of them has a different value. -->
